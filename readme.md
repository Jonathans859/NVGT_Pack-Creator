# Pack Creator for NVGT
This is a pack creator utility for the [Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit](https://nvgt.gg)

# Usage
You can simply run the "pack_creator.nvgt" script and use the easy-to-understand UI. A command-line interface is planned for later.

# Contribution credits
Thanks to [Ivan Soto](https://github.com/ivansoto0) for developing the resource_packer include.
